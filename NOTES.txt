Scope:  It needs to try sys scope first!

Solve performance problem -- aliasing.

Use heap to store symbols? Time or Space?

Namespaces vs. Classes
classes have an individual reference namespace regardless whether they're aliased or not where namespacescarry all they're info with them.  Classes may still hve local data.

Inheritance: 
    To increase effeciency, one can up copy references from a base class.  This is done in whatever the constructor is called.  Following the standard of these docs, an example may be
baseclass {
    ,; [upcopyall "Do stuff" $var me] primfun
    # ...
}
    One can still manually set which values to convert using
baseclass {
    ,; [,val upcopy "Do stuff" $var me] primfun
    # ...
}
