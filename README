DCM is a pre-Î± Embedded, interpreted, concatenative, object oriented, 
scripting language.  Feel free to clone and play with what I have, but I warn
you, it's still rather rough around the edges.  To build, do a 

$ make dcmi

Then you can play with the interpreter by running it with

$ dcmi

You can load the examples with

$ dcmi -l examples/ex.dcm

Or simply execute them with

$ dcmi -e examples/ex.dcm

Unimplemented features:

Lenses
Exception handling
Modules

Documentation is in progress
